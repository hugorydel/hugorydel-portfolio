A second essential functionality of the app was the ability to switch out profiles. Doing so allows each user to have a specific set of roles and payments systems. This intends to simplify the act of finding and efficiently purchasing the right order at the right time.

With the exception of the patterned background, I designed and built the complete site for the client. Along with a backend engineer, we then connected each of the functionalities to an existing user database and added the tool on Discord for others to download according to the client's wishes.
