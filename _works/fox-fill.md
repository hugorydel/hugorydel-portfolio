I recently completed a project where I collaborated with a client and a co-developer to create a web application that notifies merchants of limited-time bargains in the sneaker industry. The primary objective was to build an application that would allow users to track deals on popular sneaker websites using their preferred accounts. The project utilized various technologies including React.js, Material UI, Figma, and the Chrome Extension API.

### Key Points

**1. Collaboration & Feedback:**

The collaboration on this project centered around bi-weekly meetings. What I found immensely useful was to create and present three distinct Figma designs and then to talk about their pros and cons. From the outset, these prototypes helped the client visualize the user interface and provided us with a basis for discussions and feedback. We regularly communicated and adjusted the work based on the client's wants. Visualizing and sharing prototypes for review was an essential part of keeping with the client's vision for the project. Using React.js and Material UI, I developed a performant user interface for the application, which the client tested and gave me feedback on.

**2. Integrated Chrome API:**

The main functionality of the application was centered around a Chrome popup. Users could access this popup and quickly select the deals they wanted to track from popular sneaker websites.
To achieve this, I extensively studied the documentation for the Chrome Extension API and utilized its features to develop a functional and responsive UI within the Chrome popup.

**3. Exceeded Deadline:**

Throughout the development process, I worked diligently to ensure that the application was delivered before the designated deadline. I followed a well-structured development plan and implemented efficient coding practices to meet this goal.

**4. In Conclusion:**

The project was successfully completed, resulting in a fully functional Sneaker Deal Application. Users can now track limited-time deals on popular sneaker websites, customize their preferences, and receive timely notifications.
